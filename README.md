# FlightInventoryManager
A coding exercise implementing use cases for a hypothetical airfreight carrier. 

## Scenario
Transport.ly is a brand-new company that aims to provide efficient and fast air freight services; they currently have 3 planes the planes are scheduled to fly daily at noon. For this exercise, there are only 2 days of flights scheduled.

Day 1:
Flight 1: Montreal airport (YUL) to Toronto (YYZ)  
Flight 2: Montreal (YUL) to Calgary (YYC)  
Flight 3: Montreal (YUL) to Vancouver (YVR)  

Day 2:  
Flight 4: Montreal airport (YUL) to Toronto (YYZ)  
Flight 5: Montreal (YUL) to Calgary (YYC)  
Flight 6: Montreal (YUL) to Vancouver (YVR)  

With each flight returning to the YUL at midnight.  

Each plane has a capacity of 20 boxes each.

The companyâ€™s sales department has been able to sell 99 orders that are sending boxes to Toronto, Calgary, and
Vancouver, these orders are found in the attached json file. Each box represents 1 order.
As a member of the software engineering department you are asked to develop an application that can automate the
process of determining which boxes to load on each flight.

## Use Cases
USER STORY #1  
As an inventory management user, I can load a flight schedule similar to the one listed in the Scenario above. For this story you do not yet need to load the orders. I can also list out the loaded flight schedule on the console.Expected output:  
Flight: 1, departure: YUL, arrival: YYZ, day: 1  
...  
Flight: 6, departure: <departure_city>, arrival: <arrival_city>, day: x  

(Jacobson's Entiity-Control-Boundary pattern)

USER STORY #2  
As an inventory management user, I can generate flight itineraries by scheduling a batch of orders. These flights can be used to determine shipping capacity.

Use the json file attached to load the given orders.  
The orders listed in the json file are listed in priority order ie. 1..N  
  
Expected output:  
order: order-001, flightNumber: 1, departure: <departure_city>, arrival: <arrival_city>, day: x  
...  
order: order-099, flightNumber: 1, departure: <departure_city>, arrival: <arrival_city>, day: x  
if an order has not yet been scheduled, output:  
order: order-X, flightNumber: not scheduled  

## Design

The primary design goal is to comply with the SOLID principles of OOD (see reference 2). Inversion of Control will be realized by the use of a Dependency Injection Container.

### Collaboration

## Architecture

The architecture will be consistent with Clean Architecture (see reference 1) so that core logic is independent of technology used in external dependencies (such as data storage and interprocess communication).
